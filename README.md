Running 
———————————

Change directory to the R codes directory

% cd projectzed/codes

forecast.R will make figures 1, 2a, 2b, and 8a-d 

anal-corr-coh.R will make all the other figures: 3-7, 9 and 10.

In both cases the figures will be created in the ‘plots’ sub-directory.

In both cases you can run the codes either from the command line, e.g.

% Rscript forecast.R

or from within an R session:

> source(‘forecast.R’)

The util.R script includes functions used by forecast.R
